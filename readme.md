## About

 - This javascript app will ask the user to take a coding quiz and if they finish in time they will be able to add their name to the scores list (even if zero because they got the last answer wrong) but still technically finished the quiz.

## Getting Started

Just click the "Start" button and follow the directions/prompts to start another testing session.

## Installing

No installation necessary.

## Usage

This can be used to test your knowledge on coding standards and practices/information. A 10 second dent for getting the question wrong will add up quickly!! Do your research but don't rush your answer...
